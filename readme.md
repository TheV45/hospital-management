## Clinic Appointment System in Laravel

Due to the pandemic situation, we know how people should avoid sitting among strangers and maintain social distancing. But during these times, the number of patients at any clinic have also risen. So we developed a Clinic Appointment System in Laravel which helps any user to book an appointment online so as to avoid waiting in long queues and save their time and also the doctors to manage their appointment.

## Functionalities of System

- Doctor and Patient registration and signup
- Patients can select the category of doctor and book an appointment on desired time slot
- Patients can also see the prescription given by the doctor after an appointment
- Doctors can see their daily appointments on their dashboard
- Once the appointment is completed doctor can attach an prescription and mark the appointment as done
- Admin can delete an appointment in case if the doctor is unavailable for a perticular reason and patient is notified my the mail that his/her appointment is cancelled with the reason
